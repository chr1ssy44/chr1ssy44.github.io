    <h6>Hello,my name is Christina, I'm in Full Stack Development. My home school is Medgar Evers College preparatory school, I have been interested in Computer Science/Full Stack Development last year, although since I was younger I was always fascinated about computers and how they work, but never really wanted to pursue the career until last year.</h6><hr>
