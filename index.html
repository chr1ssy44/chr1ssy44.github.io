 <h2>I've been working on programming since December of 2022. I made my first ever website also in December when I first started programming, when I let my creative side show and realized I like designing websites. Working on programming has helped me to realize my real passion and talent. I look foward to advancing my Full-Stack Development skills.</h2>
